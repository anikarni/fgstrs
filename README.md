## Joint Reading - _Bhagavad Gita_

We sit in a circle and read a full text together. This
time, we take on the _Gita_.

#### The Bhagavad Gita

The Mahabharata is a two-thousand year old, 2-million word long epic whose
significance to Indian culture, even in the present day, is hard to
overestimate.  It tells the story of a contest for the Kuru kingdom, a contest
between two branches of the family (the Pandavas and the Kauravas). After
fourteen years of living in a forest, the Pandavas return to wage a battle
against the Kauravas for the kingdom.

Just before the battle begins, Arjuna, the great Pandava archer, asks the god
Krishna, who has come to earth to be Arjuna's chariotteer, to bring him to the
middle of the battlefield. Seeing amongst the Kauravas his family and friends,
he has a crisis, and wonders why he is about to kill, rather preferring to be
killed.

Krishna then speaks to him over the course of 700 verses. This small excerpt of
the Mahabharta is known as the Bhagavad Gita - The Song of God -
which Wilhelm von Humboldt describes as  "The most beautiful, perhaps the only
true philosophical song existing in any known tongue ... perhaps the deepest
and loftiest thing the world has to show."
