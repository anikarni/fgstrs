## Joint Reading - _Bhagavad Gita_

We sit in a circle and read a full text together. This
time, we take on the _Gita_.

#### The Bhagavad Gita

The Mahabharata is a two-thousand year old, 2-million word long epic whose
significance to Indian culture, even in the present day, is hard to
overestimate.  It tells the story of a contest for the Kuru kingdom, a contest
between two branches of the family (the Pandavas and the Kauravas). After
fourteen years of living in a forest, the Pandavas return to wage a battle
against the Kauravas for the kingdom.

Just before the battle begins, Arjuna, the great Pandava archer, asks the god
Krishna, who has come to earth to be Arjuna's chariotteer, to bring him to the
middle of the battlefield. Seeing amongst the Kauravas his family and friends,
he has a crisis, and wonders why he is about to kill, rather preferring to be
killed.

Krishna then speaks to him over the course of 700 verses. This small excerpt of
the Mahabharta is known as the Bhagavad Gita - The Song of God -
which Wilhelm von Humboldt describes as  "The most beautiful, perhaps the only
true philosophical song existing in any known tongue ... perhaps the deepest
and loftiest thing the world has to show."

## Joint Reading of Bhagavad Gita

The text of our first joint reading was a very special one, chosen by Julian: the [Bhagavad Gita (The Song of God)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad-Gita), an excerpt of the Mahabharata, a two-thousand year old, 2-million word long epic whose significance to Indian culture is hard to over-estimate. The ten of us took turn for approximately 3 hours and lent our voices to the God Krishna for 18 chapters of beautiful prose. Krishna, over the text, tells the righteous spiritual path to Arjuna, a warrior-prince filled with dilemna and despair as he is about about to kill with violence his ennemy. The Krishnaâ€“Arjuna dialogue cover a broad range of spiritual topics, touching upon ethical dilemmas and philosophical issues that go far beyond the war Arjuna faces. 
What a great experience was this reading! The words of Krishna still resonates in my mind: *"Outwardly performing all actions but inwardly renouncing their fruits, the wise man, purified by the fire of spiritual knowledge, attains peace, detachment, patience, spiritual vision and happiness."*
No surprise that Wilhelm von Humboldt describes as  "The most beautiful, perhaps the only true philosophical song existing in any known tongue... perhaps the deepest and loftiest thing the world has to show."
