## Joint Reading of _Bhagavad Gita_

The text of our first joint reading was a very special one, chosen by Julian: the [Bhagavad Gita (The Song of God)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad-Gita), an excerpt of the Mahabharata, a two-thousand year old, 2-million word long epic whose significance to Indian culture is hard to over-estimate. The ten of us took turn for approximately 3 hours and lent our voices to the God Krishna for 18 chapters of beautiful prose. Krishna, over the text, tells the righteous spiritual path to Arjuna, a warrior-prince filled with dilemna and despair as he is about about to kill with violence his ennemy. The Krishnaâ€“Arjuna dialogue cover a broad range of spiritual topics, touching upon ethical dilemmas and philosophical issues that go far beyond the war Arjuna faces. 

What a great experience was this reading! The words of Krishna still resonates in my mind: *"Outwardly performing all actions but inwardly renouncing their fruits, the wise man, purified by the fire of spiritual knowledge, attains peace, detachment, patience, spiritual vision and happiness."*

No surprise that Wilhelm von Humboldt describes as  "The most beautiful, perhaps the only true philosophical song existing in any known tongue... perhaps the deepest and loftiest thing the world has to show."
